# Text-Analysis-with-Python

This repo contains materials relating to my Text Analysis with Python wrkshop for Temple University Libraries' Scholars Studio (Fall 2020)

The workshop, consisting of three-four sessions, will introduce students to Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab. We will overview the basics of Python for importing and wrangling text data, before turning to more advanced text mining algorithms, topic modeling and vector space modeling (also known as word embeddings).

## Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab

[Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) are a great way to learn to code and prototype programming applicaitons. Creating by [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), Jupyter Notebooks offering an open-source, interactive web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 

There are many applications that support the use of Jupyter Notebooks, including integrated development environments like [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/). Because the installation of packages and set up of a coding environment can be time-consuming and difficult when dealing with different user' set-ups and operating systems, for this workshop, we'll be using Google Colab.

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) is a cloud-based run-time environment for coding in Jupyter Notebooks that takes advantage of Google's powerful computing resources. If you have a Google account, using Google Colab can be relatively seamless and user-friendly, integrated with Google Drive, and limiting the set-up necessary to start working. Google Colab also offers searchable code chunks to help you develop your code.

## Text Mining with Python

In the Python programming language, only a few powerful libraries are necessary to achieve interesting results. 

The [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org) has been a reliable library for the basics of text mining. The [NLTK Book guides](https://www.nltk.org/book/) you through the fundamental functions. A [hands-on NLTK tutorial](https://github.com/hb20007/hands-on-nltk-tutorial) has been created using Jupyter Notebooks.

In this workshop, we'll be using [Textblob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/), a Python package for processing and cleaning text data that makes use of NLTK, but simplifies some steps in the process. 

### Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is one of the most commonly used forms of computational text analysis. 

This workshop consists of three sessions and three Google Colab notebooks. 

The first session introduces Google Colab and the basics of Python for importing and wrangling text data.

The second session will explore visualizing topic models of text data with Gensim's LDA algorithm. 

The third session explores three-dimensional visualizations of word embedding models with Gensim's Word2Vec script and the Tensorflow Projector.
